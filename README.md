# Projects
Projects I made in Summer 2023

Hangman Game: 
  -Made on my own, to refresh my mind on C
  -Had plans to expand game to allow user to input their own string and have another user guess their phrase/word, but have not gotten around to that yet

To Do List using tk:
  -Made in Python, using ChatGPT as a guide to learn how to use tkinter (I would ask ChatGPT questions like, "How could I change the color of this button" and examined its answer and used its answer as a guide while writing my code)
  -Have not finished the to do list, only function it can currently use is create a task and quit
  -I have plans to eventually customize this to do list with my personal schedule and favorite colors
