# Projects
Projects I made in Summer 2023

Hangman Game: 
  -Made on my own, to refresh my mind on C
  -Had plans to expand game to allow user to input their own string and have another user guess their phrase/word, but have not gotten around to that yet

To Do List using tk:
  -Made in order to try and learn how tkinter works in python
  -Have not finished the to do list, only function it can currently use is create a task and quit
  -I have plans to eventually customize this to do list with my personal schedule and favorite colors
