# Projects
Projects I made in Summer 2023

Hangman Game: 
  -Made on my own, to refresh my mind on C
  -Had plans to expand game to allow user to input their own string and have another user guess their phrase/word, but have not gotten around to that yet

To Do List using tk:
  -Made in Python, using ChatGPT as a guide to learn how to use tkinter (I would ask ChatGPT questions like, "How could I change the color of this button" and examined its answer and used its answer as a guide while writing my code)
  -Have not finished the to do list, only function it can currently use is create a task and quit
  -I have plans to eventually customize this to do list with my personal schedule and favorite colors


  TicTacToe Game:
  CMD Line version: I started by trying to test my skills after recently learning java. I started by making a 2 player game that allowed for moves and had objects like Player and Board.
  I wanted to make it more complex and made an algorithm/functions for the user to play against. It is a simple output just in the terminal where you enter numbers that represent moves.

  GUI version: this version is a lot more in depth. I used pretty much the same functions/algorithm for the logic in this version. I learned how to use swing and all of its tools in order to make 3 differen GUIs for the game, where the user can pick their game mode and play against their friend or against the computer. I customized it with some basic colors and had struggles on getting to to do exactly what I wanted it to.
